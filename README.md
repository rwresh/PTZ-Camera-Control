# PTZ-Camera-Control
The PTZ Camera Control Plugin does not appear in OBS.
I am running Ventura 13.2 and OBS 29.0.2 on a Mac Mini with a M2 chip. When I install the PTZ Optics control plug, I receive a successful installed message but I cannot find the PTZ control plugin in OBS. It is not under "Dock" or under "Tools". Where can I find the plugin? Am I doing something wrong?

Here is the code file for OBS:  https://obsproject.com/logs/nDWNDecMBhgQHS8H
